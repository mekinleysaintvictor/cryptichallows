A very basic choice based RPG I'm making to enhance my coding skills. 
I need help creating a for loop to ask the player if they would like to continue or quit the game.
This game was originally a classroom assignment that I turned into an independant project to expand my knowledge and understanding
of coding. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
